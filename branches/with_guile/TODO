                                          board_tmp = board;
                                          int ret_val;
                                          ret_val = scm_call_0( func_eval_guile );
                                          return scm_num2int( ret_val, 0, NULL );
                                        }

Next steps:
* Split eval_builtin into small primitives available from Guile, such that
the weight is assigned in Scheme, not in C++.
* Split material_get_info and material_comp_info into primitives.
* Add a primitive that returns the board position in una of the standard formats, e.g. FEN. This would be suitable for an arbitrary Scheme evaluation function.
* Genetic algorithms.
