This TODO list is specifically intended to include tasks related to
the 'with_guile' branch.

* Modify int eval(const board_t * board) in src/engine/eval.cpp in the
following way:

1. Copy eval() to eval_builtin().
2. Define eval_guile(board) (SCHEME) in script.scm.
3. Implementation of eval(): call eval_guile().
4. Implementation of eval_guile(): call eval_builtin().

All that requires a type board_t exchangable between SCHEME and C++.

Hint: Guile manual, section 5.7.1 How One Might Extend Dia Using Guile

1. How to represent data in Scheme: board_t.
2. Writing Guile primitives: eval_builtin().
3. Hook for the evaluation of Scheme code: eval() -> eval_guile().
4. Top-level structure of Guile-enabled GNU Chess.
